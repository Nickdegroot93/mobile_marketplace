# Mobile Marketplace

A react native app where users can create an account and buy/sell products.

### Why this project?

This project has been created purely for learning purposes. I have spent the past year teaching myself to become a front-end developer. Getting hands on experience with React developed some interest in me for mobile development. I figured it couldn't hurt to go through a Native course and expand my skillset. Please note that the backend of this project has not been created by me.

### What's in the app?

A user can register an account and upload their items to the marketplace. All form validation for registering and uploading has been created using a combination of Formik and Yup. It uses common mobile features such using geolocation, accessing the phone's gallery, swiping up to refresh, side swipes delete, tab and stack navigators, offline support and more. The project has a focus on reusable components, clean code and a few custom hooks.
